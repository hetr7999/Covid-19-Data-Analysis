# Covid-19-Data-Analysis

Big thanks to Coursera for providing relevant data to perform this analysis. In addition , the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University.
I performed various data operations just to get hands on experience of Data manipulation. Moreover, I tried to show my results using Data visualization.
